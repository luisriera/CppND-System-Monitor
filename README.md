# CppND-System-Monitor Project

The System Monitor project is the second of the several projects within the Udacity C++ Nanodegree course.  

The original temple Source Course is clone from [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). 

The screenshot below shows my implementation of the code running on my station.
